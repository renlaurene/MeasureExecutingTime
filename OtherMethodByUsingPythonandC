Using time

import time
start = time.time()
"the code you want to test stays here"
end = time.time()
print(end - start)
    
Using for loop

import time
start = time.time()
a = range(100000)
b = []
for i in a:
    b.append(i*2)
end = time.time()
// That would output 0.02017498016357422 seconds on 
// my computer. So, the script took around 2/100 of 
// a second to execute.
print(end - start)
    
Using a list comprehension

import time
start = time.time()
a = range(100000)
b = [i*2 for i in a]
end = time.time()

// That would output 0.009402990341186523 which means 
// two times faster than the for loop. Quite a difference!
print(end - start)
